### The Bluesky Dashboard

This repository is used to generate a dashboard that allows statuses for various
services to be shown for all bluesky-related packages.

The main configuration of the dashboard is done via the ``dashboard.yml`` file,
which can contain several sections with a list of packages, and a list of
services for each section.

The dashboard can be seen at http://blueskyproject.io/status/.
